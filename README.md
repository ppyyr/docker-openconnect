# OpenConnect VPN Server
OpenConnect VPN server is an SSL VPN server that is secure, small, fast and configurable. It implements the OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The OpenConnect protocol provides a dual TCP/UDP VPN channel and uses the standard IETF security protocols to secure it. The OpenConnect client is multi-platform and available [here](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/). Alternatively, you can try connecting using the official Cisco AnyConnect client (Confirmed working on Android).

This container is an automated build linked to [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/). The dockerfile was written to always download and compile the latest release of OpenConnect VPN server when built.

# Docker Features
* Base: Alpine Edge
* Latest OpenConnect Server 0.11.10
* Size: 57.1MB 
* Modification of the listening port for more networking versatility
* Customizing the DNS servers used for queries over the VPN
* Supports tunneling all traffic over the VPN or tunneling only specific routes via split-include
* Config directory can be mounted to a host directory for persistence 
* Create certs automatically using default or provided values, or drop your own certs in /config/certs
* Advanced manual configuration for power users

# Run container from Docker registry
The container is available from the Docker registry and this is the simplest way to get it.

## Basic Configuration
### Without customizing cert variables
```
$ docker run --privileged  -d \
              -p 4443:4443 \
              -p 4443:4443/udp \
              markusmcnugen/openconnect
```
### With customizing cert variables
```
$ docker run --privileged  -d \
              -p 4443:4443 \
              -p 4443:4443/udp \
              -e "CA_CN=VPN CA" \
              -e "CA_ORG=OCSERV" \
              -e "CA_DAYS=9999" \
              -e "SRV_CN=vpn.example.com" \
              -e "SRV_ORG=MyCompany" \
              -e "SRV_DAYS=9999" \
              markusmcnugen/openconnect
```

## Intermediate Configuration (Providing own certs in /config/certs and running on port 443):
Cert files are stored in /config/certs. It will automatically generate certs if the following two files are not present in the cert directory:
```
server-key.pem
server-cert.pem
```
```
$ docker run --privileged  -d \
              -v /your/config/path/:/config \
              -e "LISTEN_PORT=443" \
              -e "DNS_SERVERS=192.168.1.190" \
              -e "TUNNEL_MODE=split-include" \
              -e "TUNNEL_ROUTES=192.168.1.0/24" \
              -e "SPLIT_DNS_DOMAINS=example.com" \
              -p 443:443 \
              -p 443:443/udp \
              markusmcnugen/openconnect
```

## Advanced Configuration:
This container allows for advanced configurations for power users who know what they are doing by **mounting the /config volume to a host directory**. Users can then drop in their own certs and modify the configuration. The **POWER_USER** environmental variable is required to stop the container from overwriting options set from container environment variables. Some advanced features include setting up site to site VPN links, User Groups, Proxy Protocol support and more.

# How to use this OpenConnect Server Docker
Install and run the docker container with your chosen options. Port forward incoming traffic on your router, some outside port to the containers IP and the listening port on the inside. After port forwarding is established you will need to create VPN accounts for users to login with usernames and passwords.

## Example:
Incoming Outside Port 4443 Forwarding TCP and UDP to the OpenConnect Servers inside IP address and listening port
![Port Forward Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkusMcNugen/docker-templates/master/openconnect/Port%20Forward%20Example.png)

## Add User/Change Password
Add users by executing the following command on the host running the docker container
```
docker exec -ti openconnect ocpasswd -c /config/ocpasswd markusmcnugen
Enter password:
Re-enter password:
```

## Delete User
Delete users by executing the following command on the host running the docker container
```
docker exec -ti openconnect ocpasswd -c /config/ocpasswd -d markusmcnugen
```

## Login and Logout Log Messages
After a user successfully logins to the VPN a message will be logged in the docker log.<br>
*Example of login message:*
```
[info] User markusmcnugen Connected - Server: 192.168.1.165 VPN IP: 192.168.255.194 Remote IP: 107.92.120.188 
```

*Example of logoff message:*
```
[info] User markusmcnugen Disconnected - Bytes In: 175856 Bytes Out: 4746819 Duration:63
```

# Issues
